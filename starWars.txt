VADER:
There is no escape.  Don't make
me destroy you.  You do not yet
realize your importance.  You
have only begun to discover your
power.  Join me and I will complete
your training.  With our combined
strength, we can end this destructive
conflict and bring order to the
galaxy.

LUKE:
I'll never join you!

VADER:
If you only knew the power of the
dark side.  Obi-Wan never told
you what happened to your father.

LUKE:
He told me enough!  It was you
who killed him.

VADER:
No.  I am your father.

LUKE:
No.  No.  That's not true!
That's impossible!

VADER:
Search your feelings.  You know
it to be true.

LUKE:
No!  No!  No!

VADER:
Luke.  You can destroy the Emperor.
He has foreseen this.  It is your
destiny.  Join me, and together
we can rule the galaxy as father
and son.  Come with me.  It is the
only way.
